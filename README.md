# gamestatconsoleapp
Console bassed RPG character statistics manager

This program will allow the user to create characters, calculate combat stats, and navigate through a menu system.

To run the program type: ./a.out into the terminal

No bonouses were added to the prgram.

The most challenging part of creating this program was figuring out how to layer the switch statements to allow the program to flow smoothly. I had a many syntax errors that I didn't catch but I was anble to correct them with time. Overall, this program was challenging but fruitful, I was able to cement my knowledge of switch statements.
